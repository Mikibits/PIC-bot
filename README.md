# PIC-bot

A Motorola PIC microntroller based multimode interface PCB I designed to drive a hobby robot platform.

## Objective

This was a hobby project I used not only to learn how to program firmware devices, but to supplement my interests to build small autonomous/learning exploring robots. I found I loved the efficient coding permitted by such a low level language as RISC Assembler, where you are literally interacting with the machine itself, one instruction at a time. I also loved the challenge of learning how to solve the fiddly little problems one has to get past to make things work on that level, with hardware that has its own limitations.

## Portfolio

This repository serves as a small example of my abilities in:

 - Coding RISC Assembler
 - Drawing electronics CAD designs
 - Technical Writing
 - Electronics construction
 
I also hope it reflects the dedication I can bring to a project, even as a hobby. 

## Success and Future version

This project was a success up to the objectives I had at the time: the PCB design and code shown here worked as expected, once I got all the bits working together. But as expected, in the process I found all kinds of ways to do it better, which became the new designs you can find in the "Future (V2)" files (see branch "Future(v2)").

## Current State

Around the time I began working on the new version, I got pulled away with some challenging paid work and haven't really come back to this. With the new SparkFun and other WIFI-ready, stamp-sized PCBs out now, there's all kinds of new directions to go in, so I imagine I will start anew if I do pick this back up. 

## The Repository

I've decided to share this here to add to my programming and electronics portfolio.

I'm also sharing it freely for anyone else who wants to get started working with embedded software as a hobby, perhaps in preparation of doing it professionally. I had great nerdy fun with it. I hope you do, too.
